# Project 3
Multithreaded robot simulation project. Invoke the `make command` to compile:
```
make
./simulate <grid size> <robots> <simulation delay> [seed]
```
When invoking the simulate executable, the simulation delay is a number in
milliseconds and represents the minimum time between each grid redraw step.

# Display
When drawing the simulation, each robot is represented with a letter on the
grid. The target block to surround is represented with the `#` character
and spaces that the robots have searched are marked with `-`.
