# README
Files included:
  - Search.java: required Java file, driver program for the project.
  - Heap.java: a Java implementation of a max/min Heap, some code reused from
    my CSCI 264: Honors Analysis of Algorithms class, modified for this
    project to store nodes for the A* algorithm.
  - Deque.java: a Java implementation of a double-ended queue, some code reused
    from my CSCI 264: Honors Analysis of Algorithms class, modified for this
    project to function as a stack for DFS and a queue for BFS.
